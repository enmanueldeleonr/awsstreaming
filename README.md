# Infrastructure as Code for Microservices Application - AWS EKS

## 1. Cloud Platform Choice: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

As a platform engineer with expertise in AWS, and considering the requirements of this project, AWS has been chosen for implementing the infrastructure. AWS provides mature and extensive services perfectly suited for a microservices architecture. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is selected as the container orchestration platform to host microservices.

## 2. Architecture Design Choices

The architecture is designed with the following key principles:

*   **Shared Infrastructure:**  Networking (VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway) and EKS cluster are envisioned as shared infrastructure components, potentially managed and provisioned separately.  Applications can then be deployed into this shared environment, reusing these resources.
*   **Modularity and Reusability:** Terraform code is structured into modules for better organization, reusability, and separation of concerns. Modules are defined for Networking, EKS, KMS, Database, Cache, Messaging, and Security Groups.
*   **Configuration Driven by YAML:**  Application-specific and infrastructure configurations are managed through YAML files, allowing for easy customization and deployment of different application environments.
*   **Individual Module Deployment (and Full Stack):**  The Terraform code supports deploying the entire infrastructure stack for a new application, or selectively deploying individual modules as needed.
*   **Reusing Existing Infrastructure:**  The configuration allows for reusing pre-existing Networking (VPC and Subnets) and EKS clusters. This is configured via YAML, specifying the IDs of existing resources.
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   **Private Subnets:** Application components (EKS worker nodes, databases, caches, message queues) are deployed in private subnets, without direct internet access.
    *   **NAT Gateway:**  Outbound internet access for private subnets is provided via a NAT Gateway in a public subnet.
    *   **Security Groups:** Security Groups are used extensively to control network traffic to each resource, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   **KMS Encryption:** Data at rest for RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, and MSK Kafka, as well as EKS secrets, is encrypted using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs). A dedicated KMS module manages the CMKs.

**Architecture Diagram:**


Security Groups:
- EKS Cluster Control Plane SG
- EKS Worker Node SG
- RDS SG (for PostgreSQL)
- ElastiCache SG (for Redis)
- MSK SG (for Kafka)

## 3. Assumptions

*   **AWS Account and Credentials:**  It is assumed that you have a configured AWS account and AWS credentials are set up for Terraform to authenticate.
*   **Terraform Installation:** Terraform is installed and configured on your local machine.
*   **YAML Configuration Files:**  Configuration for each application (e.g., `app1`, `infra_mgmt`) is provided in separate YAML files within the `config/` directory.
*   **Shared Networking and EKS (Optional):** The design supports reusing existing Networking and EKS infrastructure. If reusing, you must provide the correct IDs of existing VPC, subnets, and EKS cluster in the YAML configuration under the `existing_infrastructure` section. If creating new infrastructure, the YAML should specify `reuse_infrastructure: false` and provide the necessary configuration for Networking and EKS.
*   **Security Groups:** Security Group rules are defined to allow necessary traffic based on the principle of least privilege. These rules may need further hardening in a production environment based on specific application security requirements.
*   **KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs):**  CMKs are used for encrypting sensitive data at rest. The code creates CMKs and manages their policies. In a production environment, review and customize the KMS key policies and consider key rotation strategies.
*   **Instance Sizes and Service Capacities:**  Default instance sizes and service capacities (e.g., for RDS, ElastiCache, MSK, EKS worker nodes) are set as examples. These should be adjusted based on the actual workload and performance requirements.
*   **Secrets Management:**  Database passwords are currently hardcoded in the YAML for simplicity in this example. **In a real-world scenario, it is crucial to use a secrets management solution like AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store and retrieve secrets dynamically within your application and Terraform configurations instead of hardcoding.**
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Comprehensive monitoring and logging are essential for production deployments but are not explicitly configured in this Terraform code example. Consider integrating services like CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Kubernetes monitoring tools in a production setup.
*   **AMI for EKS Worker Nodes:** The `ami-0c55b33c5c2b32bb9` AMI ID used in the EKS worker node launch template is an example (Amazon Linux 2). You should replace this with the latest EKS-optimized AMI ID for your desired Kubernetes version and AWS region for production deployments. You can find the latest AMI IDs in the AWS documentation or using AWS Parameter Store.

## 4. Terraform Code Structure

The Terraform code is organized into modules for better structure and reusability:

*   `config/`: Contains YAML configuration files (e.g., `app1.yaml`, `infra_mgmt.yaml`).
*   `kms/`:  Defines and manages KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption.
*   `networking/`: Defines and manages the VPC, subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and Route Tables.
*   `compute/eks/`: Defines and manages the EKS cluster and worker nodes.
*   `database/`: Defines and manages the RDS PostgreSQL instance.
*   `cache/`: Defines and manages the ElastiCache Redis cluster.
*   `messaging/`: Defines and manages the MSK Kafka cluster.
*   `security_groups/`: Defines all Security Groups used in the infrastructure.
*   Root directory: Contains the root `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `provider.tf` files, which orchestrate the deployment, load configuration from YAML, and define provider settings.

## 5. How to Deploy

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   AWS Account configured.
    *   Terraform installed (version 0.13 or later recommended).
    *   AWS CLI configured (for Terraform to authenticate with AWS).
2.  **Clone the repository** containing the Terraform code.
3.  **Navigate to the root directory of the Terraform code.**
4.  **Initialize Terraform:** `terraform init`
5.  **Review and Customize Configuration:**
    *   **YAML Files in `config/`:**  Review and customize the YAML configuration files (e.g., `config/app1.yaml`, `config/infra_mgmt.yaml`) according to your needs.
        *   **Important:** If reusing existing Networking or EKS, update the `existing_infrastructure` section in the YAML with the correct IDs.
        *   **Replace placeholder values** in YAML files (e.g., VPC IDs, subnet IDs, EKS cluster name, database passwords - for passwords, consider using secrets management in real-world instead of hardcoding in YAML even for testing).
    *   **Variables in `variables.tf` (root module):** Review and customize root level variables like `aws_region` if needed.
6.  **Deploy Infrastructure (Example for `app1` application):**
    ```bash
    terraform plan -var="app_name=app1"
    terraform apply -var="app_name=app1"
    ```
    To deploy using the `infra_mgmt.yaml` configuration (for initial Networking and EKS setup):
    ```bash
    terraform plan -var="app_name=infra_mgmt"
    terraform apply -var="app_name=infra_mgmt"
    ```

## 6. Outputs

After successful deployment, Terraform will output important information:

*   `eks_cluster_name`: Name of the deployed EKS cluster (or name of reused EKS cluster if reusing).
*   `rds_postgres_endpoint`: Endpoint of the RDS PostgreSQL instance.
*   `elasticache_redis_endpoint`: Endpoint of the ElastiCache Redis cluster.
*   `msk_cluster_brokers`: Bootstrap brokers string for the MSK Kafka cluster.
*   `vpc_id`: ID of the VPC.
*   `private_subnet_ids`: List of Private Subnet IDs.

These outputs can be used to configure your microservices applications to connect to the deployed infrastructure.

## 7. Important Notes and Considerations

*   **Security Hardening:**  Review and harden Security Group rules, KMS key policies, and IAM roles for production environments. Implement proper secrets management using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging for all components using services like CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Kubernetes monitoring tools.
*   **Resource Sizing and Performance Tuning:** Adjust instance sizes, service capacities, and autoscaling configurations based on application workload testing and performance monitoring.
*   **High Availability and Disaster Recovery:** For production environments, consider Multi-AZ deployments for RDS, ElastiCache, and MSK, and implement backup and disaster recovery strategies.
*   **Cost Optimization:**  Monitor resource utilization and optimize instance types, storage configurations, and autoscaling settings to manage costs effectively. Consider using Spot Instances for EKS worker nodes for cost savings in non-critical environments.
*   **Terraform State Management:** Properly manage your Terraform state file. For team collaboration and production deployments, use a remote backend for storing the state file (e.g., AWS S3 with DynamoDB for locking).
*   **Testing and Rollbacks:** Thoroughly test infrastructure changes in non-production environments before deploying to production. Implement strategies for rolling back infrastructure changes in case of deployment failures.
*   **AMI Updates:** Regularly update the AMI ID used for EKS worker nodes to the latest EKS-optimized AMI versions for security and performance updates.
*   **Kubernetes Version Management:** Manage and upgrade your EKS cluster Kubernetes version following best practices and AWS recommendations.
